==========

RudolF open source development environment for collaborators.

This is a Vagrant vm setup which automatically sets up a vm with
java and a running mysql instance, on a 64 bit ubuntu box.  

Todo : add clojure and confirm python version.  

Also : add other libs like thrift, hadoop, etc...
